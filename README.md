# English Vietnamese Dictionary for Kindle #

Last year, I received a Amazon Kindle PaperWhite as a gift. Since then, I've been reading more books from my Kindle. 
By default the Kindle does come with few popular dictionaries from English to Chinese, Spanish, French... 
but I was a little disappointed because there is no English-Vietnamese dictionary. So I tried to find a English-Vietnamese
dictionary. Unfortunately, I have found none. Then I decided to create my own English-to-Vietnamese dictionary for the Kindle.
