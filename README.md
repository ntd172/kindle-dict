# English Vietnamese Dictionary for Kindle #

Last year, someone gave me a Kindle PaperWhite as a gift. Since then, I have been reading more books from my Kindle. 
The Kindle does come with some popular dictionaries from English to Chinese, Spanish, French... 
but there is no English-Vietnamese dictionary. I was a little disappointed  so that I tried to find a English-Vietnamese
dictionary. Unfortunately, I have found nothing. Then I decided to create my own 
English-to-Vietnamese dictionary for the Kindle.
